dotfiles
=======
My dotfiles repository is the entry point into my development environment personalization.

To fully appreciate how I go about setting up a computer, you will need to review the following repositories

- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/Traap/bootstrap) automates setting up either an OSX or a Linux machine.

- [Vim](https://github.com/Traap/vim) is used by Bootstrap to compile Vim to enable client-server and configure Vim to my liking.

- [Tmux](https://github.com/Traap/tmux) is also used by Bootstrap to setup Tmux.

- My public and private keys are referenced by Bootstrap, however, they are maintained in a private repository. 

# Project Management
Please refer to my [Lightweight Project Mangement](https://github.com/Traap/lpm)
for the project management strategy, I use.
