## dotfiles
My dotfiles repository is the entry point into my development environment personalization.

To fully appreciate how I go about setting up a computer, you will need to review the following repositories

- [Emend](http://github.com/Traap/emend) automates setting up either an OSX or a Linux machine.

- [Emend-Computer](http://github.com/Traap/emend-computer) application and
  bundle conventions [Emend](http://github.com/Traap/emend) can process.

- [Vim](https://github.com/Traap/vim) is used by
  [Emend](http://github.com/Traap/emend) to compile Vim to enable
  client-server and configure Vim to my liking.

- [Tmux](https://github.com/Traap/tmux) is also used by
  [Emend](http://github.com/Traap/emend) to setup Tmux.
