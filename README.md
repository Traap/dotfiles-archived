dotfiles
========
I began learning a the Haskell programming language last year.  During my journey, I have had
to learn to configure Haskell and Cabal on multiple operating systems:  Windows, OSX, and Linux
Mint.  Often I cycled through each operating system multiple times daily.  Lacking a common
editor was what caused me to learn Vim.  I am by no means an expert.  I have read blogs, books,
and studied how others have organized their dotfiles.  And decided to jump in.
