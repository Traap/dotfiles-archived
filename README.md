dotfiles
========
I began learning a the Haskell programming language last year.  During my 
journey, I have had to learn to configure Haskell and Cabal on multiple 
operating systems:  Windows, OSX, and Linux Mint.  Often I cycled through each 
operating system multiple times daily.  Lacking a common editor was what caused 
me to learn Vim.  I am by no means an expert.  I have read blogs, books, and 
studied how others have organized their dotfiles.  And decided to jump in.


My installation instructions are geared toward Haskell and OSX. 

Installation:
  git clone https://github.com/Traap/dotfiles.dot
  cd dotfiles
  runhaskell toosx.hs


TODO:
    1) Write tolunix.hs if toosx.hs doesn't work on Linux Mint.
    2) Write towin.hs
